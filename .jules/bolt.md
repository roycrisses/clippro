## 2025-05-15 - [Levenshtein Distance Optimization]
**Learning:** The original Levenshtein distance implementation used O(N*M) space, which is highly inefficient for large strings (like clipboard content) and can lead to OOM or high GC pressure. Additionally, calling ToLowerInvariant() on large strings before processing creates unnecessary copies.
**Action:** Use O(min(N, M)) space for Levenshtein distance and perform case-insensitive comparisons character-by-character to avoid large string allocations.
